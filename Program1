#This program combines the concepts of user inputs and loops. It's a simple dice game where the user wins if they roll a 1. The user will be prompted to roll until either a they roll a 1, or they enter 'no'.
#For a novice programer like me, it's important to understand how to set up loops that users will intereact with.
#I had to account for users making typos when prompted. If they type anything other than 'yes' or 'no', they will recieve an error message and be promted to roll again. 
r=0

while r!= 1: #Prompt user to roll dice on a loop if they haven't already rolled a 1.  
    a=str(raw_input('Do you want to roll the dice? (yes or no) '))
    if a!= 'yes' and a!= 'no': #they get an error message if they input anything besides 'yes' or 'no', but the loop doesn't break
        print('Not valid input. Please enter either yes or no')
    if a == 'no': #the user can stop the loop by entering 'no'
        print('Okay, have a nice day. You will never know what the prize was.')

    if a=='yes': 
        r=random.randint(1,6) #generates random number from 1 to 6, and stores as variable 'r'

            print('You rolled a 1!')
            print ('It took you ' +str(tries) + ' roll(s) to win. The prize is that this program will stop running.')
